# OpenCV
In this Repository, there are several codes of open cv. In this File I will be adding codes of topics like reading image in opencv, about colours, data types and structure, pixels and its manipulation, blur, dilute and erode images using open cv, adaptive image thresholding and normal thresholding, scale and rotation of image and face detection
I have added the codes, for sample image you can check which image I have taken and select the image from the files to run the code
